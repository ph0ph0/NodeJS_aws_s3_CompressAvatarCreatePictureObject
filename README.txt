This lambda was created to compress and shrink an image upload to AWS and also create a corresponding Picture object, as well as update a User object (These must obviously exist in your schema). It contains a publish script that can be ran using ./publish.sh. Note that if you want to use this in a different project, you will have to configure aws CLI and your own graphql schema to do so.
